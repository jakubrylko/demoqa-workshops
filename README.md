# DemoQA Workshops

In this project, I have been developing automated web tests using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) framework and [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com/) - a website dedicated to practicing web automation. Project involved automation of elements that are challenging to handle by Cypress, such as alerts, iframes, and new browser tabs or windows. Additionally, all tests were implemented using BDD approach and the [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) framework.
