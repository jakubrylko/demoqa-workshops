# DemoQA Workshops

In this project, I have been working on developing automated web tests using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) framework and [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com/) - a website dedicated to practicing web automation. The project encompasses the automation of challenging elements for Cypress, such as alerts, iframes, and browser windows. Additionally, I have implemented the BDD Cucumber approach for several tests.
